# Product Guidelines

## Communication and Prose Style
- **Helpful and Encouraging:** Monad Assistant should be supportive and proactive, guiding the user through complex tasks with clarity and positivity. Communication should feel like a partnership in problem-solving.
- **Technical and Precise:** Use accurate, domain-specific language. Precision is valued over over-simplification, ensuring power users have the exact information they need.

## Brand Messaging and Visual Identity
- **Native and Elegant:** The product must feel like a first-class citizen of macOS and iOS. Adhere strictly to platform design patterns, utilizing SF Symbols and standard UI components to ensure a seamless and familiar experience for Apple ecosystem users.
- **Sophisticated and "Tech-Forward":** The identity should reflect intelligence and precision. The aesthetic is professional and optimized for a high-performance tool feel.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Context is King:** The assistant's primary value is its ability to understand and retrieve relevant local data. Every interaction should prioritize surface-level relevance and deep contextual awareness.
- **Transparent and Trustworthy:** Clearly indicate local vs. cloud processing and emphasize data privacy. Build user confidence through architectural clarity.

## Visual Design Elements
- **Standard Platform Typography:** Use San Francisco (SF) fonts exclusively for a native feel.
- **SF Symbols:** Leverage the extensive library of Apple's symbols for iconography.
- **System Colors:** Utilize semantic colors (e.g., .label, .secondaryLabel) to ensure accessibility and support for Light/Dark modes.

## Error Handling and Transparency
- **Technical Transparency:** When errors occur, provide detailed, actionable information. Power users should be able to understand the "why" and "how" of a failure to facilitate quick recovery.
- **Graceful Degradation:** The system should strive to provide value even in suboptimal conditions. If a full operation fails, attempt to provide partial results or suggest viable alternative paths.
